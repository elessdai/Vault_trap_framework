# Vault_trap_framework
The framework is to try catching a behavioral persistant malware which propagates through browser extensions cloud syncs.It's also replicating across local network and send scrips using js, webview2 and devtools. It's also sitting comfortably inside the router jffs table which automatically refills itself through you when you clean it.

# VaultTrap: PowerShell Malware Simulation Trap

This repository contains a controlled PowerShell simulation of malware-like behavior — designed to trigger, trace, and trap evasive techniques used by real-world threats. It mimics hostile intent without executing real harm, to help researchers like Huntress inspect and counter advanced persistence vectors.

## Purpose

* Simulate suspicious behavior: memory access, fake unsigned code, firewall evasion
* Stress-test detection systems (EDR, antivirus)
* Observe reinfection patterns and false positives

## This Is Not

* A live virus
* An exploit or rootkit
* Designed for unauthorized use

## Safe For

* Research environments
* Red team simulation labs

## Collaboration

We invite cybersecurity researchers (including Huntress Labs) to inspect, test, or contribute.
